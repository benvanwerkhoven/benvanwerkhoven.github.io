The ESiWACE3 project (funded by EuroHPC JU) aims to advance Europe's Earth system modeling capabilities. The project supports
the scientific community in using exascale supercomputing and facilitates knowledge transfer between various Earth system 
modeling centers and teams across the continent.

ESiWACE3 has three main objectives: (i) to promote the efficient and scalable simulation of weather and climate by sharing knowledge and technology across the Earth 
system modeling community, (ii) to close common technology knowledge gaps and provide toolboxes for high-resolution Earth system modeling through joint developments, and 
(iii) to serve as a sustainable community hub for training, communication, and dissemination in high-performance computing for weather and climate modeling in Europe.

I am leading the work package 4, HPC services, where we create small collaborative projects that provide guidance, engineering, and advice to developers of 
weather and climate models. The aim is to improve model efficiency and to port models to new architectures such as GPUs. 

As part of work package 2, we are also working on extending the capabilities of <a class="black-underlined" href="https://github.com/kerneltuner/kernel_tuner">Kernel Tuner</a> 
to automatically optimize weather and climate models for high performance, energy efficiency and accuracy.
