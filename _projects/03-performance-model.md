Analytical performance models aim to capture the performance of a system in a set of simple rules or formulas.
These models are typically easy to use and can provide a lot of insight into the performance of applications.

I've created an analytical performance model that allows developers to estimate CPU-GPU data transfer times
and predict the best performing method for overlapping those transfers with GPU Computations.
