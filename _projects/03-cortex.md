The National Science Agenda (NWO NWA) has awarded a 5 million euro grant to CORTEX â€“ the Center for Optimal, Real-Time Machine Studies of the Explosive Universe. The 
CORTEX consortium of 12 partners from academia, industry and society will make self-learning machines faster, to figure out how massive cosmic explosions work, 
and to innovate wider applications.

I'm leading one of the work packages within CORTEX, where we 
investigate how to create software with the help of machine learning that can make optimal use of the computing power of modern computers. Later in
the project we will apply this technology to implement the software pipelines for observing explosive events in the universe.

As part of CORTEX, we have recently published a paper on using model-steered auto-tuning to optimize the energy efficiency of several Radio Astronomy applications,
