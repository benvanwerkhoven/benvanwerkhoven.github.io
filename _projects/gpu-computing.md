GPU Computing is the process of using Graphics Processing Units for computations other than graphics.

I've used GPUs for scientific computations as part of many applications from different scientific disciplines.

I've also been researching how we can make it easier for other people to use GPUs for their computations.
Other research topics that interest me are auto-tuning, performance modeling, and source-to-source translation.

My PhD thesis (finished in October 2014) is titled

"Scientific Supercomputing with Graphics Processing Units"</a>.
