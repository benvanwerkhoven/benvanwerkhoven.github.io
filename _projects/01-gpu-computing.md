GPU Computing is the practice of using Graphics Processing Units for computations other than graphics.

Developing GPU applications requires computations to be parallelized using specialized programming languages,
and achieving high performance requires a deep understanding of the underlying hardware.
As such, I've been researching how we can make it easier for researchers to effectively and efficiently use GPUs for their computations.
Other research topics that interest me are green computing, optimization, auto-tuning, and performance modeling.

My PhD thesis (finished in October 2014) is titled

"Scientific Supercomputing with Graphics Processing Units"</a>.

More recently, in 2020, I've published a paper on the
<a class="underlined" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13227.pdf">lessons learned in a decade of research software engineering GPU applications</a>.
