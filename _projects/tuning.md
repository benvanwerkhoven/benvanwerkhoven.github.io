title: Auto-tuning GPU code
---

I've created the Kernel Tuner to make it as simple as possible to auto-tune and test CUDA and OpenCL kernels using simple Python scripts.

While the Kernel Tuner is designed to be easy to use, I also want it to be feature complete.
To this end, the Kernel Tuner supports many advanced use cases, such as tuning parameters in both host and device code.

The Kernel Tuner is open source and welcomes contributions, check it out on <a style="color: black;" class="underlined" href="https://github.com/benvanwerkhoven/kernel_tuner">GitHub</a>!
