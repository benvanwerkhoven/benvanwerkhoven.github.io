In 2016, I've created Kernel Tuner to make it as simple as possible to auto-tune and test CUDA and OpenCL kernels using simple Python scripts.

While Kernel Tuner is designed to be easy to use, over the years it has grown into a comprehensive auto-tuning toolbox, with several tools being built on top.
Kernel Tuner supports many advanced use cases, such as tuning parameters in both host and device code, a large selection of
optimization algorithms, and using code generators.
Kernel Tuner is open source and welcomes contributions, check it out on
<a class="underlined" href="https://github.com/KernelTuner/kernel_tuner">GitHub</a>!

Kernel Tuner has been used to accelerate many scientific applications and has become an important tool for research in GPU auto-tuning. For an overview of use cases and publications,
