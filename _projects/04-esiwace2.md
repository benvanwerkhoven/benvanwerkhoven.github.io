The EU H2020 funded Centre of Excellence in Simulation of Weather and Climate in Europe (ESiWACE) enables global storm- and eddy resolving weather and climate simulations on the 
upcoming (pre-)Exascale supercomputers.

I am leading the work package on HPC services, where we create small collaborative projects that provide guidance, engineering, and advice to developers of 
weather and climate models. The aim is to improve model efficiency and to port models to new architectures such as GPUs.
