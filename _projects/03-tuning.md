I've created Kernel Tuner to make it as simple as possible to auto-tune and test CUDA and OpenCL kernels using simple Python scripts.

While Kernel Tuner is designed to be easy to use, I want it to be a comprehensive auto-tuning toolbox.
To this end, the Kernel Tuner supports many advanced use cases, such as tuning parameters in both host and device code, a large selection of
optimization algorithms, and using code generators.

The Kernel Tuner is open source and welcomes contributions, check it out on
