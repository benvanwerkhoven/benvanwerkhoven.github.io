I a co-founder of the Netherlands Research Software Engineer community (NL-RSE).
Since April 2017, the community has grown rapidly to 200+ members from 35+ institutes within the Netherlands.

I'm also an active member of the international RSE movement by participating
in steering or program committees of various conferences and events. I'm involved in the organization of:  
&bull; the <a class="black-underlined" href="https://researchsoftware.org/council.html">International RSE Council</a>,  
&bull; Research Software Engineers in HPC workshop series (<a class="black-underlined" href="http://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2020/">RSE-HPC</a>) at Supercomputing,  
&bull; International Series of Online Research Software Events (<a class="black-underlined" href="https://sorse.github.io/">SORSE</a>),  
&bull; and the <a class="black-underlined" href="https://research-software.org/2020-workshop.html">2nd Intl. RSE Leaders Workshop</a>.
